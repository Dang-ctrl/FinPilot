Personal Finance Tracker GUI
This is a simple, yet effective, desktop application for personal finance tracking, built using Java with the Swing framework. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to help users manage and monitor their income and expenses, offering a more intuitive experience than a command-line interface.

The application's core functionality is to track financial transactions and provide a clear overview of a user's financial health. All transaction data is saved to a local CSV file, ensuring persistence between sessions.

Key Features
Transaction Management: Easily add new transactions, specifying the description, amount, type (income or expense), and a relevant category.

Persistent Data: All data is automatically saved to a transactions.csv file, so your records are safe even after closing the application.

Dynamic Table View: A clear, interactive table displays all recorded transactions.

Financial Summary: View a summary of your total income, expenses, and current balance with a single click.

Filtering Options: Filter transactions by a specific category or within a custom date range to analyze your spending habits more closely.

User-Friendly Interface: The application is built with a simple and clean GUI, making it accessible to users of all technical levels.

How to Run
Save the file: Save the code from the Canvas as FinanceTrackerGUI.java.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Compile the code using the Java compiler:

javac FinanceTrackerGUI.java

Run the application using the Java runtime:

java FinanceTrackerGUI

The application window will appear, allowing you to start tracking your finances immediately.
